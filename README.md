# AriticleSimilarity

  Using text vectors for article similarity comparison,The generation of vectors used Python's sense transformers package, and similarity calculation used Iris's vector cosine calculation. The front-end uses bootstrap and CSP

# Installation

  ## 1.docker
  
   1.1 Pull the code to a local directory
   
     $ git clone https://github.com/ADAQIQI/AriticleSimilarity.git
     
   1.2 Download the model and place it in the specified directory, which can be found in the https://huggingface.co/ Taking the BERT model as an example, download it and place it in the same directory

  If the model used is not BERT, it is necessary to Modify Article Similarity Vector's GetEmbeddingPy Change the directory to the folder used in 1.2
